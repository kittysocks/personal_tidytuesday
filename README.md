Molly's Personal #tidytuesday Repo

Highly benefitting from the library(tidytuesdayR). My original plan was to just fork the tidytuesday repo and sync every week, and create a new branch for each week, but that's complex! I hope to contribute lots of fun and colorful data visualizations to #tidytuesday!
